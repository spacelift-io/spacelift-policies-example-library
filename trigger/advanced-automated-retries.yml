description: |
  Sometimes Terraform or Pulumi deployments fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the code
  - think eventual consistency between various cloud subsystems, transient API errors etc.
  This trigger policy will restart the failed run up to a maximum number of times. This policy can also be configured
  on a per stack basis by setting `spacelift_retry:<number>` on the stacks labels.
labels:
  - trigger
  - retries
  - automated
  - failed
