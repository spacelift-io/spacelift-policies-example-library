type: access
description: |
  Assuming you have the Slack integration setup, you could
  attach this policy to a given stack, and this would provide
  the Slack Channel "dev-notifications" access to your Spacelift
  stack's data.
  NOTE: If you are looking to scope access to individual Slack channels
  you should consider using the channel id, rather than the name, as names can change.
labels:
  - access
  - slack
  - channels
  - teams
