  Sometimes you have folks (short-term consultants, most likely) who are
  not members of your organization but need access to your Spacelift account -
  either as regular members or perhaps even as admins. There's also the situation
  where a bunch of friends is working on a hobby project in a personal GitHub account
  and they could use access to Spacelift. Here's an example of a policy that allows
  a bunch of allow-listed folks to get regular access and one to get admin privileges.

  NOTE: This feature is not available when using single sign-on -
  your identity provider must be able to successfully validate each user
  trying to log in to Spacelift.
