name: Set Head Commit No Trigger
source: set-head-commit-no-trigger.rego
type: push
description: |
  This policy is designed to set the head commit without initiating a tracked run, addressing scenarios such as where the run is triggered by external processes. 
  It ensures that the head commit is updated to reflect the latest changes in the tracked branch. 
  This approach is particularly useful in complex CI/CD workflows where multiple triggers may result in redundant runs, offering a solution to streamline the process and focus on efficiency.
