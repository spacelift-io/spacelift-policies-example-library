  This push policy leverages pull request comments to initiate Spacelift runs, specifically designed for customizable workflows. 
  It requires read access to repository issues and subscription to issues comments events on the VCS provider.
  The policy processes comments beginning with `/spacelift` to trigger actions, such as deploying a stack, provided the comment is made by a member of the development team. 
  This ensures controlled execution based on team member inputs without processing edited or deleted comments.
