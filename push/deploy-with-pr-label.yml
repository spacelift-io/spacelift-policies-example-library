  This policy enables automatic deployment based on the presence of a specific label ("deploy") on a pull request (PR). It ensures streamlined operations where:
  - Tracked runs are triggered for PRs marked with the "deploy" label, facilitating immediate deployment actions for approved changes.
  - Proposals for runs are the default behavior, ensuring that all changes are evaluated, but only those with explicit deployment intent are automatically progressed.

  The policy optimizes the deployment process by aligning runs with development workflows, specifically leveraging PR labels to control deployment timing and execution, enhancing both automation and control within CI/CD pipelines.
