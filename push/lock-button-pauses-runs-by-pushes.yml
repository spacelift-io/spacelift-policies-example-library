description: |
  This push policy introduces a condition where runs are paused if the stack is locked, ensuring that no automated processes interfere during critical periods. 
  - Proposed runs are considered for all branches under the same non-locked condition.
  - Any push to a branch without changes is ignored.
  
  The policy enhances control over the deployment pipeline, allowing users to lock the stack as a means to pause automated runs, providing an additional layer of security and management for infrastructure changes.
