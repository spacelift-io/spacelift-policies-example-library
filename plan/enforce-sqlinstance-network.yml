description: |
  This policy aims to enhance security by denying changes that would expose a Cloud SQL instance to the public internet (0.0.0.0/0).
  By scrutinizing changes to Google Cloud SQL instances during the planning phase, the policy ensures that no instance is inadvertently made accessible to any IP address, thereby mitigating potential security risks.
  The enforcement applies to both the creation and updating of resources, promoting best practices in cloud security and infrastructure management.
