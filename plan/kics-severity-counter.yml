description: |
  This policy integrates with the KICS (Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure) tool to monitor and enforce security best practices by evaluating the severity of issues detected in the infrastructure code. 
  It issues warnings for information, low, and medium severity issues, providing a detailed count for each category to help prioritize fixes.
  However, it takes a stricter stance on high severity issues by denying any run that contains them, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are addressed before proceeding with deployment.

  The goal is to embed security within the CI/CD process, making sure that infrastructure deployments not only meet functional requirements but also adhere to the highest security standards.
