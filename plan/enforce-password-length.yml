description: |
  This policy enforces stringent password policies within Terraform-managed resources, specifically targeting the creation of `random_password` resources.
  It denies the creation of passwords shorter than 16 characters to prevent the use of weak passwords and issues a warning for passwords under 20 characters, recommending stronger, more secure passwords.
  This approach ensures adherence to security best practices, significantly enhancing the overall security posture by mandating robust password criteria.
