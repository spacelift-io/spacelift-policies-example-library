description: |
  This policy facilitates a streamlined workflow for trusted engineers, allowing their commits to be deployed automatically, under the assumption that the Stack is set to autodeploy and their changes have undergone code review. 
  It specifies an allowlist of individuals whose contributions are considered safe for direct deployment, thereby reducing bottlenecks in the deployment process for routine or low-risk changes.

  The policy aims to balance speed and security by enabling trusted engineers to operate with greater autonomy while ensuring that contributions from others are subject to human review, maintaining a high standard of scrutiny for the majority of changes.
