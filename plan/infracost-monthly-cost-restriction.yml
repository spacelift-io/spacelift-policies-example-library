description: |
  This policy utilizes Infracost data to enforce cost controls on infrastructure deployments by:
  - Denying changes that increase monthly costs beyond a $100 threshold, ensuring that budget limits are respected.
  - Issuing warnings for increases exceeding 5%, highlighting significant cost impacts and encouraging cost optimization discussions.

  By integrating cost estimates directly into the CI/CD process, this policy helps maintain financial discipline, ensuring that infrastructure changes are both necessary and cost-effective.
