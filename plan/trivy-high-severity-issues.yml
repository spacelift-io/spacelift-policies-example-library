description: |
  This policy is designed to warn about the presence of high severity issues identified by Trivy, a security tool for scanning vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in IaC projects, including Terraform code. The policy specifically looks for high severity misconfigurations within the provided scan results.
  When high severity issues are detected, the policy generates a warning message to highlight these vulnerabilities. This approach ensures that significant security issues are addressed promptly, contributing to the maintenance of high security standards in IaC projects.

  Integrating Trivy with Spacelift policies allows teams to automate the security review process, ensuring that critical issues are flagged for resolution before deployment.
