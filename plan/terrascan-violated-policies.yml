description: |
  This policy integrates Terrascan, a comprehensive static code analysis tool for Terraform, to monitor and enforce security best practices. 
  It issues a warning if any violated policies are detected, providing a count of such incidents. 
  More critically, if the number of violated policies exceeds a set threshold (specifically, more than 2), the policy will deny the run, preventing potentially insecure infrastructure changes from being deployed.

  The goal is to embed security within the CI/CD process, ensuring that infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments adhere to established security guidelines and reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable or non-compliant resources.
