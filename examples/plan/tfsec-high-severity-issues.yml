name: Tfsec High Severity Issues
source: tfsec-high-severity-issues.rego
type: plan
description: |
  This policy is designed to warn about the presence of high severity issues identified by tfsec, a security tool for Terraform code. 
  If the number of high severity issues is below a certain threshold (in this case, less than 5), a warning message is generated to highlight the need for attention and remediation. 
  This proactive approach to security ensures that significant vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, contributing to the maintenance of high security standards in infrastructure as code (IaC) projects.

  Integrating tfsec with Spacelift policies allows teams to automate the security review process, ensuring that critical issues are flagged for resolution before deployment, thus embedding security within the CI/CD pipeline.
