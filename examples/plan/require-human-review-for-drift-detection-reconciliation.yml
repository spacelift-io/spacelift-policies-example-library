description: |
  This policy mandates manual approval for reconciling any detected drifts in infrastructure configurations.
  Drift detection is a crucial aspect of maintaining the desired state of infrastructure, identifying discrepancies between the actual state and the expected configuration as defined in code.

  When drift is detected, this policy ensures that changes aimed at reconciliation are not automatically applied but instead are subjected to human review.
  This requirement for manual approval helps in ensuring that the proposed changes are indeed appropriate and in alignment with the organization's infrastructure management policies and practices.
