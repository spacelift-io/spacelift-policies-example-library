description: |
  To enhance reviewability and manageability of changes, this policy enforces a limit on the commit size by automatically denying or warning against changes that affect more than 50 resources. 
  The threshold is set to ensure changes remain within a reasonable scope, facilitating thorough reviews and minimizing the risk of overlooked issues. 

  For PROPOSED runs, changes exceeding this limit will be denied, promoting smaller, more manageable updates. 
  For all other run types, a warning will be issued, still allowing for deployment but with a mandatory human review to ensure careful consideration of extensive changes.
