description: |
  This policy ensures that stacks adhere to labeling conventions by verifying the presence of mandatory labels and the absence of unacceptable ones. 
  Mandatory labels such as "mandatory1" and "mandatory2" must be present for a stack to be compliant. Additionally, while labels "acceptable1" and "acceptable2" are permitted, the presence of any labels outside these specified acceptable and mandatory categories triggers a denial.

  The policy aims to enforce consistent labeling practices across stacks, facilitating better organization, filtering, and governance of infrastructure resources within Spacelift.
