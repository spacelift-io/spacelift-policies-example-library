# The push policy can be used to have the new run pre-empt any runs that are
# currently in progress. The input document includes the in_progress key, which
# contains an array of runs that are currently either still queued or are awaiting
# human confirmation. You can use it in conjunction with the cancel rule like this:
cancel[run.id] {
	run := input.in_progress[_]
	run.type == "PROPOSED"
	run.state == "QUEUED"
	run.branch == input.pull_request.head.branch
}
