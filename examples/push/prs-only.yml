  This policy ensures that runs are closely aligned with pull request (PR) activities, focusing on enhancing the integration and deployment workflows.
  It triggers proposed runs for any PR event, while tracked runs are specifically reserved for PR merges into the tracked branch.
  By ignoring all non-PR related events, this policy streamlines the deployment process, ensuring that only meaningful changes that have undergone review are considered for deployment.
  This approach is critical for maintaining high standards of code quality and efficiency.
