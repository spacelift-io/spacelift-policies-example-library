description: |
  Designed for Git push events, this policy filters out all changes that do not occur within a project's root directory. It standardizes the workflow by:
  - Triggering tracked runs for changes within the project root on the tracked branch.
  - Proposing runs for changes within the project root on all other branches.
  - Ignoring tag pushes and any changes outside the project root.
  
  The policy's focus is to maintain relevance and efficiency in CI/CD pipelines by ensuring that only significant changes—specifically, source files within the project root—initiate Spacelift runs.
