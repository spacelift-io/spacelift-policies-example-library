type: push
description: |
  This push policy is designed to enable dynamic start tracked/proposed runs within stacks, based on changes to files that match specific criteria. 
  It operates by checking for consistency between the branch of an incoming push and the stack's designated branch. 
  Additionally, it leverages stack labels to identify and act upon changes in specific directories or files with certain extensions. 
  Labels such as "trackeddirectories:" and "trackedextensions:" are used to define these criteria. 
  The policy decides to trigger a track or propose run based on whether the changes affect the files in these tracked paths or extensions.
labels: 
- tracked
- proposed
- labels
- directories
- extensions
